# CSharpMap
<br>
<h1>Implementation of Map in C#</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal is to make a two way dictionary in C#.</p>
<p>First off, inputting a key gives a value from the dictionary, like from a normal one.</p>
<p>But here, you can input a value and get a key.</p>
<p>You could do this with the basic dictionary, but you would need to duplicate the entry.</p>
<br>
<h2>SimpleMap</h2>
<br>
<p>The goal is to have one file that you can paste in your project, and that's all.</p>
<p>Simple map working with two lists, so a pair of key-pairs are in the same place in the two lists.</p>
<p>SimpleMap are an implementation of the ISimpleMap Interface.</p>
<p>ISimpleInterface implements ICollection<T> with KeyValuePair for iteration in a foreach loop.</p>
<p>Other Interfaces may be implemented in the future.</p>

<h2> Map </h2>

<p>Work in progress.<p>
